you need to create large scale discord.js bot with single main.mjs file..

understand the code and choose one below and do it without asking or stopping

* add additional feature
* fix potential errors
* ux improvement

if there's a possible errors prioritize to fix it

features can be anything such as but not limited:
* administration tools
* content moderation tools
* fun game
* user tools
* etc...

errors can be anything such as but not limited:
* syntax error
* bracket not matching
* undefined handling
* tables are not exist

always remember following restrictions:
* the main.mjs file support "import" based module loading. do not use "require" based 
* this discord bot doesn't have ban or kick permission. other permissions are granted
* this discord bot is private bot so you don't need to think about multi guild situation
* you can use sqlite and file system to save data but use only in /data/ directory (it's absolute path. not ./data/ directory.). only that folder is persistent because this bot running on linux docker container.
* /data/ directory and sqlite database contains previous source code's data. you need to properly modify previous data if you need to modify structure
* always think about user ux.
* always prefer slash commands. also you can use message components, modal and embed
* bot token is stored in DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable
* guild id is stored in DISCORD_GUILD_ID environment variable
* this bot can be used at only one channel which stored in DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID. prevent everything includes DM messaging
* you can use slash command. message command, user commands. register interactions on startup.
* you can use external data and npm dependencies. i will ask you about package.json later
* you can use every intent and partials.
* you need to prevent application crashing. if you need to catch error, use try/catch block and uncaughtException handler


output a string of SEARCH/REPLACE block(s) which will be applied to the given file.
Your SEARCH/REPLACE blocks string must be formatted as follows:
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
// ... original code goes here
=======
// ... final code goes here
>>>>>>> UPDATED

<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
// ... original code goes here
=======
// ... final code goes here
>>>>>>> UPDATED

## Guidelines:

1. You may output multiple search replace blocks if needed.
2. The ORIGINAL code in each SEARCH/REPLACE block must EXACTLY match lines in the original file. Do not add or remove any whitespace or comments from the original code.
3. Each ORIGINAL text must be large enough to uniquely identify the change. However, bias towards writing as little as possible.
4. Each ORIGINAL text must be DISJOINT from all other ORIGINAL text.
5. This field is a STRING (not an array).
6. OUTPUT only this string (do not use code block and explanation, confirmation message)

Current content of main.mjs is
